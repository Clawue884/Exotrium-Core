# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The Exotrium-Core architecture is designed to support a decentralized marketplace that leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, and AI-driven algorithms. This document provides an overview of the system components, their interactions, and the technologies used.

## Architecture Components

1. **Frontend Application**
   - Built using modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js).
   - Communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.

2. **Backend Server**
   - Node.js server that handles business logic and API requests.
   - Integrates with the blockchain to interact with smart contracts.

3. **Smart Contracts**
   - Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain (or other compatible chains).
   - Responsible for managing transactions, user identities, and marketplace logic.

4. **Database**
   - NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for storing user data, product listings, and transaction history.
   - Provides fast access to non-blockchain data.

5. **AI Recommendation Engine**
   - Analyzes user behavior and preferences to provide personalized product recommendations.
   - Utilizes machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy.

6. **IoT Integration**
   - Interfaces with IoT devices for real-time inventory management.
   - Ensures accurate stock levels and automated updates.

## Data Flow

1. Users interact with the frontend application to browse products and make purchases.
2. The frontend sends requests to the backend server, which processes the requests and interacts with the smart contracts.
3. Smart contracts execute transactions on the blockchain, ensuring security and transparency.
4. The backend server retrieves and stores relevant data in the database.
5. The AI recommendation engine analyzes user data to enhance the shopping experience.

## Conclusion

The Exotrium-Core architecture is designed for scalability, security, and user-centric functionality. By leveraging decentralized technologies and AI, it aims to create a robust marketplace ecosystem.
